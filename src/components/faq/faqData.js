    que: "What is FTTx Technology?",
    ans: `FTTx. (Fiber To The X) means all possible optical fiber topologies from a telecom or cable carrier to its customers, based on the location of the fiber's termination point.
        X can be anything from below mentioned list.

    que: "What is the difference between ADSL and FTTH?",
    ans: `ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) services are given on copper (telephone) lines. Whereas FTTH (Fiber To The Home), on the other hand, adopts optical fiber that allows long-distance transmission and more stable signals.

    que: "What benefits we offer to the society under FTTx Service?",
    ans: `We offer below benefits to the society who permit us to lay Fiber for FTTx service:
        • Gigabit Home Broadband
        • Intercom/Telephone
        • Ready Infrastructure for Surveillance & Automation - Most of the upcoming surveillance and automation solutions run on IP/Ethernet, the fiber optic network could be reused for connecting the same.
        • Common Wi-Fi Area`,
